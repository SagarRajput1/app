# User-Centric Security Features in Android Applications

This project demonstrates the implementation of user-centric security features in Android applications. The application incorporates three primary security-focused features:

1. **Password Strength Meter**: A tool that evaluates the strength of user passwords and provides real-time feedback.
2. **Permission Management System (2FA with OTP)**: A two-factor authentication (2FA) system using One-Time Password (OTP) to ensure secure access.
3. **Educational Modules**: Interactive modules designed to educate users on security best practices.

## Features

### 1. Password Strength Meter
- **Functionality**: Evaluates the strength of passwords as users create or update them.
- **Criteria**: Includes checks for length, complexity, and common patterns.
- **UI**: Provides visual feedback through color-coded strength indicators.

### 2. Permission Management System (2FA with OTP)
- **Functionality**: Enhances security by requiring an OTP during login.
- **OTP Verification**: Users must enter a 4-digit OTP sent via SMS or email.
- **Security**: This ensures that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is prevented.

### 3. Educational Modules
- **Content**: Interactive lessons covering topics such as creating strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, and managing app permissions.
- **Engagement**: Users can complete quizzes and track their progress.
- **Goal**: To raise awareness and knowledge of security practices among users.
